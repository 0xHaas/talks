# Inspiration

My speaker rider closely mirrors [Cassidy Williams's speaker-rider](https://github.com/cassidoo/talks). 

I've noticed a number of conferences I have previously spoken at have become less inclusive over the years (largely due to cost of attendence) - and I believe Cassidy has done a fantastic job at building a speaker-rider which promotes inclusive event participation and proper inclusion for all participants. If I am ascribing my name to something, it must coincide with what I believe in. 

# Speaker Rider 

Before I'll agree to speaking at a conference or meetup, I always research to make sure that it aligns with my goals of inclusion and diversity in InfoSec. In particular, I try to focus on events that strongly feature underrepresented groups within information security (usually local to the Bay Area). 

I love speaking at events, and am always delighted to participate! I feel so privileged to be considered, and want to use that privilege to help the InfoSec community be as inclusive as possible, where everyone can feel represented and have a seat at the table. 

If I say no to your event (even if you do all of the below), please don't take it personally! Because I speak often, it's likely because I have a conflict, or I need to back off because I speak too much. This is especially true for events that require travel. 

## Hosting accommodations

### Travel

- I ask that travel to and from the event is provided (assuming it is not local, I'm currently based in San Francisco)
- I'm a member of numerous airlines and hotel rewards programs. If organizers of an event are booking on my behalf, I ask that you use one of those if possible!
- I do ask too that if I'm booking my own travel/lodging, that I be reimbursed quickly.

### Lodging

- I ask that lodging is provided for the full length of the event, unless the event is local.
- For events outside of the US (or just far away from San Francisco), I ask for at least one full day of lodging before the event since I'll likely be flying in a day or two before.

### Speaker honorarium

- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too), I often have to take time off of work or projects to travel and attend, and because I want to normalize people getting paid for their work.
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive this based on ticket pricing, scholarship programs, etc.

### Ticket

- I ask for a ticket to the full conference as a speaker. I love participating in conferences, engaging with other attendees, and attending talks! 

## Logistics

### Timing 
- If there are any events at the conference specifically focused around D&I, I'd love to not be presenting at the same time. I heavily value attending these talks/sessions/events and would prefer to be in attendance. 

### Code of Conduct

- This is an absolute requirement - and should be strongly enforced. 
- Here's a couple great CoC examples: [JSConfEu](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/), [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), and [BSidesORL](https://2020.bsidesorlando.org/#/Event?lang=en) 

### No white-majority, all-men lineups
- No matter the setting, this isn't appropriate. If you are struggling to find people outside of these demographics, I'd love to talk about potential diversity measures you can take to promote a more inclusive environment. 
- Underrepresented minorities shouldn't be exclusively invited to speak about their experiences as a minority in tech.

### Recordings/Intellectual Property

- I'm fine with being recorded, but please let me know ahead of time.
- I guarantee that everything I do is rated "PG" with no swearing or inappropriate/explicit remarks.
- I use [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/) if I am using slides. I regularly post my slides here in this repo -- and I can provide a generated PDF of my slides or Markdown.

### Bonus points I would love to see

- Live captioning is incredibly beneficial to those who are hard of hearing, struggle with focus, or prefer to process written information.
- Gender pronoun identification provided by some method for attendees to self-identify if they so choose is awesome and should be encouraged.
- I struggle a lot with remembering names, so name-tags for those who feel comfortable sharing theirs is critical for me. 
- A scholarship program for those who can't otherwise afford to attend is huge - but please make sure the process is equitable and open to all. 
- The ability to use my own computer/setup is preferred. This is also important for those who need to use assistive technologies on a given machine -- and given my usual topic matter, may be a requirement. 

## Final thoughts

Thank you so much for reading through all of this! I hope none of it is particularly surprising, and that it's reasonable for you. I want to speak at events that are inclusive, diverse, and accessible to everyone, and hope to contribute to the community surrounding them. If you disagree with parts of this, or want to discuss terms more, I am all ears and would love to speak further.
