Jonathan's Talks
===================

I tend to talk about information security, software engineering, venture capital, and productivity. 

Check out my [speaker rider](./speaker_rider.md) if you'd like me to speak at your event!

*NOTE:* Talks are in markdown, but they might look funky.  That's because I run them in [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com/).
